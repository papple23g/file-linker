# Progress Tracker

## 2025/05/10
- Initialized all Memory Bank documents (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md).
- Completed initial implementation of the main project structure (hover-provider, file-opener, extension).
- Next Steps: Alt key detection, hover behavior optimization, PowerShell command security hardening, hover UX improvements.

- **Goal**: Address failures on machines without Everything installed.
- **Action 1**: Bundled the Everything command-line tool (`es.exe`) directly into the extension to resolve path issues.
- **Action 2**: Identified the subsequent problem: `es.exe` requires the main Everything service to be running.
- **Decision**: Implemented "Plan B" for error handling.
- **Action 3**: Modified the extension to detect if the Everything service is not running (via exit code 8) and display a clear, user-friendly error message in English.
- **Action 4**: The error message now includes a button that links directly to the Everything download page.
- **Action 5**: Updated all user-facing documentation (`README.md`, `package.json` description) to be in English and to clearly state the dependency on the Everything service.
- **Next Steps**: Update remaining Memory Bank files and prepare for publishing.
